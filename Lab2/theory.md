Assignments

1.1- Initialize some variables in the R workspace. Now analyze and display what are variables are created, then delete the single variable as well as all the created variables.

2.2- Initialize two numbers dynamically, then perform the four arithmetic operations on them.

2.3- Initialize two vectors and then check both vectors are equal or not?

2.4- Initialize two vectors with 1s and 0s. Now perform AND operation with two vectors.

2.5- Initialize a vector, then find itâ€™s length and multiply 3 to each every element. After this, initialize another vector and add two vectors.
2.6- Initialize a vector and display those elements who are larger than 80 and less than 100.
2.7- Input a 3-digits number and print its 1st and last digit.
2.8- Initialize a vector and check whether a particular value is available in this vector or not.
